  "I’m a full-stack developer based in Granada, Spain. Over the past year, I’ve balanced a full-time job with my passion for coding, dedicating most of my free time to learning by building projects and sharpening my skills. My experience has equipped me to create responsive web applications using React, Node.js, MongoDB, and JavaScript. Currently, I’m expanding my expertise with Angular through my latest project, which is still in progress.",
  "I particularly enjoy working on projects that solve real-world problems. There’s something incredibly satisfying about turning an idea into a functional solution. When I’m not coding, you can find me hiking, playing board games or video games with friends, or staying active through calisthenics, gym workouts, or helping with tree planting at a land restoration project.",
  "I thrive both in team settings and when working independently. My experience as a summer camp manager honed my teamwork and leadership skills, while my time as a teacher and developer has made me adept at self-motivation and working autonomously. I’m always eager to connect with others who share my passion for technology, so feel free to reach out if you’d like to collaborate or just chat."
